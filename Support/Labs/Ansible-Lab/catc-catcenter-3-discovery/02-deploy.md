## Part A — Device Discovery (4.0)

### Step 1 — Encrypt the Vault

```bash
cd ~/TECOPS-2599/Support/Resources/Ansible/4.0-Cisco-Catalyst-Center-Device-Discovery
cp vault.yml.example vault.yml
ansible-vault encrypt vault.yml --vault-password-file ~/.vault_pass
```

### Step 2 — Run the Playbook

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml device_discovery.yml \
    --vault-password-file ~/.vault_pass
```

Discovery jobs are submitted asynchronously to Catalyst Center. The Workflow Manager module polls each job to completion before returning, so a successful `PLAY RECAP` means every IP in `device_list` has been processed (reachable + authenticated, or marked unreachable with a reason).

> [!TIP]
> If devices land in *Partial Collection Failure* or *Unreachable* state, the cause is almost always credential mismatch. Re-check that the CLI / SNMP credentials assigned to the site in Module 2 match the real device credentials (`netadmin / C1sco12345` for the DCLOUD pods).

### Step 3 — Verify in Catalyst Center

1. **Tools → Discovery** — the most recent job should show as *Complete*.

   ![Discovery Job](../../images/ansible/discovery/discovery.png?raw=true)

2. **Provision → Inventory** — every IP from `device_list` should appear with *Reachability: Reachable* and *Manageability: Managed*.

   ![Inventory](../../images/ansible/discovery/inventory.png?raw=true)

   At this point all devices are sitting under `Global` — that is correct; Part B places them.

## Part B — Assign To Site (5.0)

### Step 4 — Encrypt the Vault

```bash
cd ~/TECOPS-2599/Support/Resources/Ansible/5.0-Cisco-Catalyst-Center-Assign-To-Site
cp vault.yml.example vault.yml
ansible-vault encrypt vault.yml --vault-password-file ~/.vault_pass
```

### Step 5 — Run the Playbook

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml assign_to_site.yml \
    --vault-password-file ~/.vault_pass
```

The recap shows one *changed* result per site that needed devices moved into it. Re-running produces `changed=0`.

### Step 6 — Verify in Catalyst Center

Return to **Provision → Inventory** and look at the **Site** column for each device — it should now reflect the path from `settings.json` (e.g. `Global/NA/Pod-1`) instead of `Global`.

## Summary

The pod devices are in inventory and parked at the correct site. From here Catalyst Center can apply settings, push templates, and provision Day-N config — the next three modules cover those steps.
