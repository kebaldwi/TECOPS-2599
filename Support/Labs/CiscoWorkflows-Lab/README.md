# Catalyst Center Orchestration with Cisco Workflows

## Overview

This Lab is designed as a standalone lab to help customers with varying challenges in Automating and Orchestrating their network infrastructure. Within the lab, we will use various tools and techniques to Automate various tasks and orchestrate Catalyst Center.

## Network management is far too complex

Complexities of network environments that involve multiple devices, configurations, and policies. These environments often include legacy systems, various hardware types, and differing compliance requirements, making management incredibly challenging. 

The Networking Landscape complexity is increased with islands of management planes, discontiguous implementation flows, especially where multiple controllers are involved.

Double administration at times for monitoring which leads to wasted time, and inability to track change across it all.

## Complexity creates challenges for network and security teams

<img src="../images/workflows/readme/COMPLEXITY.png" alt="Workflow Properties" style="width:100%; height:auto;">

Complexity leads to inaccuracy which leads to failures. Error prone processes and troubleshooting cause a loss in time due to Management Plane sprawl which is compounded by the growth and demand of the networks today.

* *What if it didn’t have to be that way.*
* *What if management planes could talk to one another, without fate sharing,
without complex integrations.*
* *What if this could somehow even be driven by events or even AI.*

## Cisco Workflows - *'What is it?'*

Meraki has added a well-established Cisco tool to the dashboard; Workflows. But let’s be very clear, it’s not just for Meraki. Customers can use this powerful automation and orchestration engine on pretty much anything. In addition to Meraki, it can be used for automating Cisco controllers like Catalyst Center, SD-WAN, ISE, ThousandEyes, ACI, Nexus Dashboard, Intersight, Webex, IOT, and anything Cisco or 3rd party that utilizes REST-API. If it has a REST API or an SSH adapter, Workflows can automate it.

If you can use Microsoft Visio, you can use Workflows.

## General Information

In this lab, we will use a complete set of Cisco Workflows which use REST API requests to automate and orchestrate network devices through Catalyst Center. This lab will focus on Catalyst Center orchestrations to build intent and templates to drive configuration.

This set of Labs is developed around a set of simple use cases to show both the power of Catalyst Center, the REST APIs, and easy methodologies for execution through Cisco Workflows.

The lab will utilize a set of Cisco Workflows publicly shared on Cisco Workflows Exchange and those workflows may be installed and customized for your own use.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Please note that LAB content in this Repository is aligned with specific DCLOUD Demonstrations that have to be set up by either a **Cisco Employee** or a **Cisco Partner**. If you are having trouble accessing the DCLOUD content please get in touch with your **Local Cisco Account Team**.

## Lab Modules

The Story we will use will be the following, after orientation, we will first construct our design. The design consists of a hierarchy, settings and credentials. With the hierarchy set, we still discover our pod devices and then import templates to Catalyst Center. We will then build a Network Profile, and provision devices. 

The use cases we will cover are the following which you can access via the links below:

1. [**Orientation**](./catc-catcenter-0-orientation/01-intro.md)
2. [**Building Hierarchy**](./catc-catcenter-1-hierarchy/01-intro.md)
3. [**Assign Settings and Credentials**](./catc-catcenter-2-settings/01-intro.md)
4. [**Device Discovery**](./catc-catcenter-3-discovery/01-intro.md)

## Summary

This lab is intended for educational purposes only. Use outside of a lab environment should be done at the operator's risk. Cisco assumes no liability for incorrect usage.

This lab is intended to help drive the adoption of REST API and will be added to over time with various use cases. The Public Workspace will also mirror the changes and be kept up to date. We hope this set of labs helps explain how the REST API may be used and goes a little further in helping define and document them.
